        Here's a selection of projects I've worked on:

        ### Physics-Informed Neural Network for COVID-19 (Nittany AI Advance)
        Along with a team of four others, I developed a PINN using the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Vaccinated compartmental model for tracking COVID-19 spread.

        ### Analyzing Customer Satisfaction in Online Food Ordering 
        Using a dataset from Kaggle, this project involved building and comparing multiple regression models to identify the key drivers of customer satisfaction. Within this project, I implemented ridge, lasso, and logistic regression techniques.

        ### Centre County Economic Sector Analysis
        As part of my role at the Penn State Office of Entrepreneurship and Commercialization, I was tasked with analyzing the performance of economic sectors within Centre County. I presented my results to various economic leaders within the county and made the case that funding for startups in the manufacturing sector should be increased.
        

        I'm always excited to collaborate and build things that matter!
