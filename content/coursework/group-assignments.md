        This section contains the group assignments I was tasked with completing in IST110.

        ## Virtual Information Treasure Hunt
        For this assignment, we were tasked with locating an academic article through the PSU Library database that explores the impact of information overload on decision-making. After selecting an article, we were asked to summarize its key points and share our findings with our group.

        Communicating with my group members was a challenge in this project that lead to us submitting the assignment late. However, I learned from this experience and improved communication in my later group assignments.
