        This section contains the group assignments I was tasked with completing in IST110.

        ## Virtual Information Treasure Hunt
        For this assignment, we were tasked with locating an academic article through the PSU Library database that explores the impact of information overload on decision-making. After selecting an article, we were asked to summarize its key points and share our findings with our group.

        Communicating with my group members was a challenge in this project that lead to us submitting the assignment late. However, I learned from this experience and improved communication in my later group assignments.

        ## Exploring Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)
        In this group assignment, we explored different types of OSINT and their real world applications.

        Throughout my research, I focused on signals intelligence, which involves the collection of foreign intelligence through the interception of communications and electronic signals. Overall, this was an informative assignment since I was not aware of all of the intelligence collection metjods.

        ## Infographic on a Security Concept
        In this assignment, my group collaboratively designed an inforgraphic that explained a security concept of our choice. We chose account security.

        Within this project, I learned that delegation is essential to group work. We delegated research across two of our group members, and the third group member was responsible for creating the infographic. This led to us working collaboratively and submitting the assignment in a timeline manner.
