        This section contains the individual assignments I was tasked with completing in IST110.

        ## L00 Setting up your Enterprise Software:
        In this assignment, I set up enterprise software on my personal computer for all Microsoft products, Adobe Acrobat Pro, and Adobe Express. I learned that Penn State provides various applications for student use, and as a result, I was later able to take advantage of more applications provided by Penn State.

        ## L01: Intro to GenAI: Part 1
        This assignment involved learning about AI through various tutorials and questions. This included learning about neural networks. As a data science major, AI is an integral part of my studies, and I was able to learn a lot more about how neural networks work, which is essential to the completion of my degree.

        ## L02: History and Basics
        In this lesson, I learned about the history of computers and major figures who contributed to the development of computer science. As someone who uses computers every day, I never considered how they were created and who made them. I found it especially interesting that one of the founders of computer science was a woman. 

        ## L03: Create an Infographic
        Within this assignment, I created an infographic to explain the four pillars of computational problem solving. As a result of this assignment, I learned how to create an informative infographic, while also learning more about computational problem solving, which are methods I now apply to my studies.

        ## L03: 3D Printing
        In this assignment, I went through the process of printing a 3D item at Penn State. Throughout this assignment, I learned how to use a 3D printer and design 3D items through the software.

        ## L04: Hardware Dissection Lab
        Within this activity, I virtually took apart an iPhone 4 and desktop computer to observe the hardware components inside the devices. As a result of this assignment, I learned what the inside of electronic devices look like, and how hardware is set up to make our electronics work.

        ## L05: In this lesson, I learned how operating systems function and about the common operating systems. As a Mac user, it was very interesting to learn about the other types of operating systems, especially Linux. 

        ## L06: Intro to GenAI:Part 2
        In this activity, I wrote a prompt to ask three GenAI tools (CoPilot, ChatGPT, and Perplexity) to solve an issue or problem. Throughout this assignment, I was able to compare the outputs of the three GenAI tools and determine which one is best for my uses. After completing this assignment, I determined that ChatGPT is my favorite GenAI platform.

        ## L06: In this activity, I practiced coding in Python. Although I already knew how to code in python, this was a nice refresher on how variables, print statements, and variable assignment.

        ## L07: In this lesson, I learned about core word processing, spreadsheet, presentation, and database actions. It was very useful to learn about spreadsheet formulas especially since I use excel frequently.

        ## L08: In this lesson, I used about messaging services, computer applications, streaming applications, Wikipedia, and basic cloud computing applications and purposes. I really enjoyed learning about audio player apps, particularly bit depth, file compressions, and audio player apps.

        ## L09: I learned how to code HTML in this activity, and I made a basic webpage. I had never coded in HTML before, so it was very interesting to learn the basics of web development.

        ## L10: In this lesson, I learned about different types of unauthorized computer access, how to protect a computer from unauthorized access, and different previous widespread internet attacks. I found it particularly interesting to learn more about denial of service attacks, especially since I had heard about these previously.

        ## L11: In this lesson, I learned about how information can be accessed on the internet and how personal information can be protected on the internet. I found the concept of metadata very interesting, because I never knew that location information could be extracted from an image.

        ## L12: In this lesson, I learned about common societal problems caused by the internet. Since I know people who have been cyberbullied in the past, it was good to learn about tips to prevent and stop cyberbullying. 

        ## L13: In this lesson, I learned about how business is conducted on internet, basic cloud computing applications and purposes, how people can together on the internet, and what kind of creation legally belongs to a person. I found it especially interesting to learn about intellectual property, fair use, and patenting, especially since I have been worried about possibly violating fair use.
