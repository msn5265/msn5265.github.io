        Here are the discussion posts I was tasked with creating in IST110.

        ### L01 Discussion: Work Style Discussion Post
        Within this assignment, we were tasked with identifying the work style that we most align with, and why understanding work styles is important. Below is my response:

        I most closely identify with "The Arranger" work style.  When working in a group, I thrive at creating close team bonds and making sure that everyone is closely engaged with the project at hand.  I am good at listening to everyone's ideas, and welcoming diverse perspectives.  However, I do not struggle with hitting deadlines, unlike the traditional arranger.

        I do think that understanding work styles can lead to better group collaboration.  This is because we are able to work better in a team when we understand our own blind spots and address them independently. Furthermore, understanding how others best communicate and work in a group dynamic helps facilitate greater group understanding and situational awareness.

        ### Analyzing Customer Satisfaction in Online Food Ordering 
        Using a dataset from Kaggle, this project involved building and comparing multiple regression models to identify the key drivers of customer satisfaction. Within this project, I implemented ridge, lasso, and logistic regression techniques.

        ### Centre County Economic Sector Analysis
        As part of my role at the Penn State Office of Entrepreneurship and Commercialization, I was tasked with analyzing the performance of economic sectors within Centre County. I presented my results to various economic leaders within the county and made the case that funding for startups in the manufacturing sector should be increased.
        

        I'm always excited to collaborate and build things that matter!
