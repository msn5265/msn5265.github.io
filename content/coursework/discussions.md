        This section contains the discussion posts I was tasked with creating in IST110.

        ## L00 Discussion: Introduce Yourself
        In this assignment, we were instructed to introduce ourselves and identify what interests us most about IT. Below is my response:

        Hi everyone, my name is Maya Nagiub and I am a junior at Penn State main campus. I am a data science major, and that is the field of IT that appeals most to me.   I feel that data science is a rewarding field as it attempts to solve real world problems using a data driven approach,  and it helps businesses tailor their actions toward customers.  However, it is hard to communicate these difficult concepts to stakeholders and it is difficult to find quality data at times.  It is also very technical, and I am not very good at coding nor do I enjoy it very much.  I do enjoy communicating with others and translating technical solutions in a way that is easy for non-technical people to understand. Outside of class, I am a THON captain, and I enjoy working out, hiking, and painting.

        ### L01 Discussion: Group Collaboration
        Within this assignment, we were tasked with identifying the work style that we most align with, and why understanding work styles is important. Below is my response:

        I most closely identify with "The Arranger" work style.  When working in a group, I thrive at creating close team bonds and making sure that everyone is closely engaged with the project at hand.  I am good at listening to everyone's ideas, and welcoming diverse perspectives.  However, I do not struggle with hitting deadlines, unlike the traditional arranger.

        I do think that understanding work styles can lead to better group collaboration.  This is because we are able to work better in a team when we understand our own blind spots and address them independently. Furthermore, understanding how others best communicate and work in a group dynamic helps facilitate greater group understanding and situational awareness.

        ### L09 Discussion: The Internet and the web
        Within this discussion post, the prompt was "Defining the Internet and the Web: Differentiate between the terms "Internet" and "World Wide Web." What is the Internet, and what role does it play in enabling global connectivity? How does the Web relate to the Internet, and what additional layer does it bring to the digital experience?". Below is my response:

        The internet has undeniably become a powerful driver of globalization, profoundly influencing social, political, and economic spheres. With the dramatic rise in internet users worldwide, the spread of ideas and information has accelerated at an unprecedented pace. This connectivity brings numerous benefits. Consumers now enjoy access to goods and services that were once out of reach in their local markets, while access to information and the ability to engage in electronic exchanges have significantly improved. Moreover, communication has become faster and more convenient, with text and voice messaging allowing people to connect instantly across the globe.

        However, there are a variety of ethical concerns that are associated with the internet. Some people have access to the internet while others do not, which creates inequality, especially since a lot of organizations assume that everyone has equal access to the internet. Privacy concerns are another issue, since personal information can be stolen and shared online. 

        Overall, the relationship between globalization and the internet has been largely positive. However, there are a variety of ethical challenges that we should continuously seek to overcome.
